Responsive Website Assignment

This is my homework for the Response Website assignment. I made three pages and included a style.css to handle the different screen sizes from desktop to mobile. Below I will describe each of my pages

Index.html
This is the starter page for this assignment. It has my biography and links to the others pages.

Portfolio.html
This page is used to show the list of projects that I have completed.

Contact.html
This page is used to send me a message if the reader wanted to get in contact with me

Style.css
I used the Bootstrap.CDN reference per the assignment, but I included another style sheet so that I could control how the pages responded on smaller screen resolutions.
